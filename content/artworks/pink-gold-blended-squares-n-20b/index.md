A composition inspired by both modern tiling algorithm and ancient Arabic patterns.
This piece is plotted on a pen plotter tailor made to handle large paper using alcohol-based "gold" and pink ink and a pump marker on an A1 white sheet.
⚠️ Gold ink is challenging to photograph, and its color has been edited to appear closer to reality. However, please note that the actual color may differ.
