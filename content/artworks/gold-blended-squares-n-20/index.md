A composition inspired by both modern tiling algorithm and ancient Arabic patterns. This piece is plotted on a pen plotter tailor made to handle large paper using alcohol-based "gold" ink and a pump marker.⚠️ Gold ink is challenging to photograph, and its color has been edited to appear closer to reality. However, please note that the actual color may differ.
