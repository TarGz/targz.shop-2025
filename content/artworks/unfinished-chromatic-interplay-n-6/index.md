An Exploration of Color Moiré. Chromatic Interplay is a generative Pen Plotter Art piece created using my own P5.js code, this artwork is part of a series of patterns called Chromatic Interplay. Each iteration of Chromatic Interplay is plotted multiple times, employing different colors and pen angles. This piece is a variation where I have stopped the plot on this piece before completion because its beauty struck me just as it is.
