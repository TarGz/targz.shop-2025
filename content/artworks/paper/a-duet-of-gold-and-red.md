This piece showcases an interplay of thick gold lines and delicate red accents. The boldness of the gold lines is complemented by the subtle touch of red, creating a visually striking composition.⚠️ Gold ink is challenging to photograph, and its color has been edited to appear closer to reality. However, please note that the actual color may differ.
